## libUV

A module map that points at libuv, I'm using version 1.8.0r1, but it shouldn't
matter, as long as you've installed some version of libuv... and that it lives
in your `/usr/local/include` directory.

#### Note:
I will probably change the name to CLibUV for sake of Swift naming conventions.
